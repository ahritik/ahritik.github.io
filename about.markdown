This is Hritik Arasu's site. I will be teaching myself some programming, robotics, and pursue some activities in Machine Learning. Starting from Fall 2020, I will be a student at the University of Washington and would love to get some more hands-on experience.

You can email me at [hritikarasu@gmail.com](hritikarasu@gmail.com)
Some projects that I have done in the past can be found at [ahritik](https://github.com/ahritik)
