<p>This is Hritik Arasuâ€™s site. I will be teaching myself some programming, robotics, and pursue some activities in Machine Learning. Starting from Fall 2020, I will be a student at the University of Washington and would love to get some more hands-on experience.</p>

<p>You can email me at <a href="hritikarasu@gmail.com">hritikarasu@gmail.com</a>
